# RavePI

Welcome to Nicaragua's project: RavePI.

This repository contains both a backend API and a basic frontend app that allows the user to view and filter Nicaragua's best backpacker parties!

For the custom made API, I created 3 key endpoints:

- /parties - returns all parties and supports location and day as query parameters
- /parties/:party - returns the specified party's data
- /locations - returns all locations

The database was created using SQLite.

I was eager to throw myself back into the backend for this project, and really enjoyed refamiliarising myself with SQL commands and endpoint creation, plus comprehensive testing!

Have a play about and see which party takes your fancy, or filter down to your desired day or location.
