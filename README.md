# RavePI

Welcome to Nicaragua's project: RavePI.

This repository contains both a backend API and a basic frontend app that allows the user to view and filter Nicaragua's best backpacker parties!

For the custom made API, I created a database using SQLite and then build 3 key endpoints using an Express app.

I was eager to throw myself back into the backend for this project, and really enjoyed refamiliarising myself with SQL commands and endpoint creation, plus comprehensive testing!

Have a play about and see which party takes your fancy, or filter down to your desired day or location.

Frontend hosted independently [here](https://nicaragua.cat-miller.com/).
Backend hosted independently [here](https://nicaragua-api.cat-miller.com/parties).

A full write up, with further information about the project, can be found on [What's My Country Code - Nicaragua](https://whatsmycountrycode.cat-miller.com/nicaragua).
